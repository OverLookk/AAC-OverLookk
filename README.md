## How Fast Is It?
Honestly, I'm not sure exactly how fast it can go, but during testing, it gave around **15,000+ clicks per second (CPS)**, it was laggy when on some websites so its hard to tell, but itâ€™s fast.

**Note**: It does use some CPU when processing large amounts of clicks, but I only experienced a high of around 20% CPU usage at most.
